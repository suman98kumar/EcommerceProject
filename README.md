# E-commerce Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project aims to leverage K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their search behaviour on a well-known e-commerce website. By analyzing purchase patterns and search preferences, we can gain valuable insights to improve marketing strategies and personalize customer experiences.

Problem Statement:

Given a dataset containing customer information like gender, number of orders, and brand search frequencies, use K-Means clustering to:

Identify distinct customer segments based on their search behaviour.
Understand purchasing patterns within each segment.
Dataset:

Source: Well-known e-commerce website.
Timeframe: Data collected over a specified period.
Features:
Cust_ID (Unique customer identifier)
Gender (Customer gender)
Orders (Number of past orders)
35 brand features (Times each customer searched specific brands)
Methodology:

Data Preprocessing:
Address missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation, deletion).
Normalize or scale brand search frequencies for better clustering.
K-Means Clustering:
Implement K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their search behaviour.
Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using techniques like the silhouette score.
Analysis and Interpretation:
Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., dominant brands searched, average order count).
Draw insights into purchasing patterns and customer preferences within each segment.
Learning Outcomes:

Gain hands-on experience with K-Means clustering for customer segmentation.
Understand the relationship between customer search behaviour and purchase patterns.
Leverage data analysis to inform marketing strategies and personalize customer experiences.
Scope:

This project focuses on K-Means clustering as the primary segmentation technique. Further exploration could involve:

Comparing K-Means with other clustering algorithms (e.g., hierarchical clustering).
Incorporating additional customer data (e.g., demographics, purchase history).
Developing targeted marketing campaigns based on customer segments.
