E-commerce Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Abstract:

This project aims to leverage K-means clustering to segment customers of a well-known e-commerce website based on their search behavior. By analyzing their past purchase patterns and brand search frequency, the project seeks to uncover valuable insights into customer preferences and purchase trends. This knowledge can then be used to personalize marketing campaigns, improve product recommendations, and ultimately increase sales.

Problem Statement:

Given a dataset containing customer search data from an e-commerce website, this project utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to:

Identify groups of customers with similar search and purchase patterns.
Obtain valuable insights into customer preferences and behavior.
Develop data-driven strategies for improved marketing and customer engagement.
Dataset:

The dataset consists of customer information including:

Cust_ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Customer's gender.
Orders: Number of past orders placed by the customer.
Brands: 35 features representing the number of times each customer searched for specific brands.
Scope:

This project focuses on the following areas:

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and clean the data for analysis.
Explore data distribution and identify potential outliers.

Feature Engineering:
Create additional features if necessary based on existing data.
Apply feature scaling to ensure equal importance during clustering.

K-Means Clustering:
Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the silhouette score.
Cluster customers based on their brand search frequency and purchase behavior.

Analysis and Interpretation:
Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.
Identify trends and patterns within each segment.
Gain insights into customer preferences and purchase behavior.

Learning Outcomes:
Understand the application of K-means clustering in customer segmentation.
Gain practical experience with data analysis and interpretation.
Develop skills in drawing insights from customer data for business applications.
